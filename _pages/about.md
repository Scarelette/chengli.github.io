My name is Cheng Li, and I am a Chinese girl with a deep fascination for advanced technologies that enhance our daily lives, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and computational linguistics. Over the past two years, I have conducted research exploring the cognitive mechanisms of LLMs (e.g., _EmotionPrompt_ and _NegativePrompt_), multicultural understanding of LLMs (_CultureLLM_ and _CulturePark_), and AI for healthcare (_MentalArena_). I was a research intern at UIUC advised by Prof. Heng Ji. And I have a long internship at Microsoft Research Asia advised by Prof. Xing Xie and Dr. Jindong Wang. Looking ahead, I aspire to contribute to more impactful and innovative work on large models.
